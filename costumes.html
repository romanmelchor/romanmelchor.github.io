    <h2>Putting a smile on the face of every child in a wheelchair.</h2>
    <p>
      Ryan and Lana Weimer, the founders of Magic Wheelchair, have five children, three of whom were born with Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which requires the use of wheelchairs for the entirety of their lives.</p>

<p>Each Halloween, Ryan made the biggest, “baddest” costumes he could for his sons, Keaton and Bryce, for many years. Once news of these costumes spread, Ryan began receiving requests from parents around the world asking if he would transform their kids’ wheelchairs into “magic”…and then, in 2015, Ryan and Lana decided to make that happen and started the non-profit organization that seeks to put a smile on the face of every child in a wheelchair.</p>
